# Network Coding for Security Communication
This is a project for generate linear program from Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) that has one eavesdropper in one channel and solve it.
To show that how to establish secure channel using random bits and send messages through the channel. We will see how many bandwidth we can use to send messages through this channel.
